## Challenge Overview

Your mission encompasses several critical tasks:

### 1. **UI Consistency and State Management**:
- Identify inconsistencies at the component design level, particularly components serving the same purpose but depicted with different designs. Highlighting such discrepancies is crucial for both user experience (UX) and developer experience (DEVX).
- Examine provided UI designs for missing states, including `hover`, `active`, `focus`, `press`, `with-content`, `without-content`, `is-valid`, and `invalid`. Document these omissions as they are essential for a comprehensive design system.

### 2. **Usability Testing**:
- Conduct a thorough usability review of the given workflow (Withdrawal/KYB/C flow). Assess its intuitiveness, ease of navigation, and overall user experience, providing detailed feedback and improvement suggestions.

### 3. **Automated Testing of a Web App Flow**:
- Select a flow within our web application designs provided. Assume that the code was present, Ideate test cases for different states and edge cases.
