## Challenge Overview

Your mission encompasses several critical tasks:

### 1. **UI Consistency and State Management**:
- Identify inconsistencies at the component design level, particularly components serving the same purpose but depicted with different designs. Highlighting such discrepancies is crucial for both user experience (UX) and developer experience (DEVX).
- Examine provided UI designs for missing states, including `hover`, `active`, `focus`, `press`, `with-content`, `without-content`, `is-valid`, and `invalid`. Document these omissions as they are essential for a comprehensive design system.

### 2. **Usability Testing**:
- Conduct a thorough usability review of a given workflow (Withdrawal/KYB/C flow). Assess its intuitiveness, ease of navigation, and overall user experience, providing detailed feedback and improvement suggestions.

### 3. **Automated Testing of a Web App Flow**:
- Select a flow within our web application, such as the sign-in or sign-up process. Automate this testing using Selenium or a similar tool, ensuring to include test cases for different states and edge cases. We will provide specific IDs within the flow to facilitate automation.

### 4. **Integration and Edge Case Testing**:
- Assess how different parts of the application integrate, focusing on consistency and the seamless transition between linked endpoints. For example, verify that an invoice sent by a user registered as an "iwoc company" correctly reflects a 0.9% charge on the invoice for both the payee and payor.
- Test edge cases across all flows, such as the availability of instant payouts and the behavior of sign-up processes for requested customers.

### 5. **Security and Access Control Testing**:
- Verify the security of the application by testing different accounts' access to various resources, ensuring that non-authenticated endpoints are accessible only as intended (with appropriate tokens).

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on the following aspects:

- **Detail-Oriented Observation**: Precision in identifying UI inconsistencies and missing design states.
- **Analytical and Critical Thinking**: Quality of usability feedback, understanding of user experience, and practical improvement suggestions.
- **Technical Proficiency**: Skill in automating tests, demonstrating familiarity with testing frameworks and tools.
- **Integration Insight**: Ability to understand and test the integration between different parts of the system, ensuring seamless operation and consistency.
- **Security Awareness**: Vigilance in identifying potential security vulnerabilities and ensuring robust access control.
